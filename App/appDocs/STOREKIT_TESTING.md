# StoreKit Testing Guide

## Overview

Life Wrapped uses StoreKit 2 for in-app purchases. This guide covers how to test the purchase flow using Xcode's StoreKit Configuration file.

---

## Setup (One-Time)

1. **Open Xcode** → Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme (⌘<)
2. Select **Run** on the left sidebar
3. Click the **Options** tab
4. Set **StoreKit Configuration** to `Config/StoreKitConfiguration.storekit`
5. Click **Close**

---

## Testing Purchase Flow

### Normal Purchase

1. Run the app in Simulator or device
2. Go to Settings, then AI & Summaries (or the Year Wrap engine sheet)
3. Tap "Cloud AI" (shows a 🔒 lock icon and "One-time $2.99 • Tap to unlock")
4. Tap "Unlock for $2.99, once"
5. Confirm in the simulated App Store sheet
6. ✅ Purchase completes instantly

### Reset Purchases (Test Again)

**Method 1: Xcode Debug Menu**

1. With app running, go to Xcode menu bar
2. **Debug → StoreKit → Manage Transactions**
3. Select the transaction you want to delete
4. Click **Delete** (trash icon) or right-click → Delete
5. Return to app - feature should be locked again

**Method 2: Clear All Purchase History**

1. **Debug → StoreKit → Clear Purchase History**
2. This removes ALL test purchases
3. App resets to "not purchased" state

**Method 3: Delete App & Reinstall**

- Delete the app from Simulator/device
- Run again from Xcode
- All StoreKit test data is cleared

---

## Testing Error Scenarios

### Interrupted Purchases

Simulates user closing the purchase sheet mid-transaction:

1. **Debug → StoreKit → Enable Interrupted Purchases**
2. Attempt a purchase in the app
3. The purchase will be "interrupted" (pending)
4. **Debug → StoreKit → Manage Transactions**
5. You'll see a pending transaction
6. Click **Approve** or **Decline** to complete/cancel

This tests your app's handling of:

- `Transaction.updates` listener receiving delayed transactions
- UI state when purchase is pending: the purchase sheet shows "Waiting for approval. Cloud AI unlocks as soon as the purchase is approved."
- Recovery from interrupted purchases: approving it while the sheet is open closes the sheet with a "Cloud AI unlocked" toast

### Failed Purchases

Test how the app handles purchase failures:

1. Open `Config/StoreKitConfiguration.storekit` in Xcode
2. In the left sidebar, click the **⚙️ Editor** tab (gear icon)
3. Under **StoreKit Errors**, enable errors for specific operations:

| Error Type         | What It Tests              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Load Products**  | Product info fails to load |
| **Purchase**       | Purchase transaction fails |
| **Verification**   | Receipt verification fails |
| **App Store Sync** | Sync with App Store fails  |

4. Run the app and trigger the operation. The purchase sheet shows a plain-language message under the button (for example "Couldn't reach the App Store. Check your connection and try again."); cancelling shows nothing
5. **Remember to disable errors** after testing!

### Specific Error Codes

You can also simulate specific StoreKit errors:

1. In StoreKitConfiguration.storekit → Editor tab
2. Under a specific error type, click the dropdown
3. Choose an error like:
   - `userCancelled` - User taps Cancel
   - `paymentNotAllowed` - Payments restricted
   - `networkError` - No internet
   - `unknown` - Generic failure

---

## Testing Restore Purchases

1. Complete a purchase (follow Normal Purchase steps)
2. Clear app data or reinstall app
3. Go to **Settings → Purchases → Restore purchases** (or use Restore purchases on the purchase sheet)
4. Cloud AI unlocks again, with a "Cloud AI restored" toast

To test restore when nothing was purchased:

1. Clear all purchase history (Debug → StoreKit → Clear Purchase History)
2. Tap Restore purchases
3. The app says "No Cloud AI purchase was found for the Apple Account signed in to the App Store."

When Cloud AI is already unlocked, Restore purchases says "Cloud AI is already unlocked." without asking the App Store.

---

## Testing Redeem Code

The purchase sheet's **Redeem code** button opens Apple's offer code sheet (`.offerCodeRedemption`). Offer codes work for non-consumables on iOS 16.3 and later.

- **In Xcode:** add an offer code to the Cloud AI product in `StoreKitConfiguration.storekit`; the Transaction Manager can then trigger a redemption.
- **In the sandbox:** create codes in App Store Connect (the in-app purchase, then Offer Codes). Sandbox accounts have no redemption limit.

A redeemed code arrives through `Transaction.updates`, which unlocks Cloud AI and closes the sheet. Closing Apple's sheet without redeeming shows nothing.

---

## Testing on Real Device (Sandbox)

For testing with real App Store Connect (before release):

### Setup Sandbox Tester

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Users and Access → Sandbox → Testers
3. Create a new sandbox tester account
4. Use a unique email (can be fake, e.g., `test@example.com`)

### Test on Device

1. On your iOS device: Settings → App Store → Sign Out
2. Run the app from Xcode
3. When prompted to purchase, sign in with sandbox account
4. Complete purchase (no real charges in sandbox)

**Note:** Don't sign into the main Settings with sandbox account - only use it when the App Store prompt appears.

---

## Debugging Tips

### View Transaction Logs

1. **Debug → StoreKit → Manage Transactions**
2. Shows all test transactions with:
   - Transaction ID
   - Product ID
   - Purchase date
   - Status (purchased, refunded, etc.)

### Print Debug Info

The `StoreManager` logs purchase events:

```
🛒 [StoreManager] Checking entitlements...
🔓 [StoreManager] Cloud AI unlocked: true
🛒 [StoreManager] Purchase successful for smartestAI
```

### Common Issues

| Issue                         | Solution                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product not loading           | Check Product ID matches exactly                          |
| Purchase button does nothing  | Check StoreKit Configuration is set in scheme             |
| Purchased but still locked    | Call `checkEntitlements()` or check `Transaction.updates` |
| "Cannot connect to App Store" | Using real device without sandbox? Use StoreKit config    |

## App Store Submission Guide

When you're ready to submit to the App Store, follow these detailed steps to configure your In-App Purchase in App Store Connect.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] An active Apple Developer Program membership ($99/year)
- [ ] Your app created in App Store Connect
- [ ] A Privacy Policy URL (required for apps with IAP)
- [ ] A Support URL for your app
- [ ] Bank and tax information set up in App Store Connect (Agreements, Tax, and Banking)

---

### Step 1: Create the In-App Purchase Product

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Click **My Apps** → Select **Life Wrapped**
3. In the left sidebar, click **Monetization** → **In-App Purchases**
4. Click the **+** button (or "Create" if first IAP)
5. Select **Non-Consumable** as the type
6. Fill in the details:

| Field              | Value                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Reference Name** | Cloud AI                             |
| **Product ID**     | `com.jsayram.lifewrapped.smartestai` |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: The Product ID must match EXACTLY what's in `StoreManager.swift`. This cannot be changed after creation! (The product was first named "Smartest AI"; the reference and display names can be renamed, the ID stays `smartestai`.)

7. Click **Create**

---

### Step 2: Configure Pricing

1. After creating the product, you'll be on the product detail page
2. Click **Add Pricing** (or the pricing section)
3. Select your **Price Tier**:
   - Tier 1 = $0.99
   - Tier 2 = $1.99
   - Tier 3 = $2.99 ← (current price)
   - Tier 5 = $4.99
   - etc.
4. Choose **Start Date**: Select when the price takes effect (usually "Today")
5. Optional: Set different prices for different countries
6. Click **Save**

---

### Step 3: Add Localization

At least one localization is **required** for review.

1. Scroll to **App Store Localization** section
2. Click **Add Localization** (or the + button)
3. Select **English (U.S.)** (or your primary language)
4. Fill in:

| Field            | Value                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Display Name** | Cloud AI |
| **Description**  | Detailed summaries with your own AI key |

5. Click **Save**

**Optional**: Add more languages if your app is localized:

- Spanish: "IA en la nube" / "Paga una vez para usar tu propia clave de OpenAI o Anthropic..."
- etc.

---

### Step 4: Add Review Information

This is **required** for Apple's review team to test your IAP.

1. Scroll to **Review Information** section
2. Add a **Review Screenshot**:
   - Take a screenshot of the purchase screen in your app
   - Should show the "Unlock Cloud AI" sheet (`Images/Iphone/inapp-purchase.jpg` is the current one)
   - Resolution: At least 640x920 pixels
   - Format: PNG or JPEG
3. Add **Review Notes** (explain to Apple what this IAP does):

```
This one-time, non-consumable purchase unlocks "Cloud AI", which lets users connect their own API key for OpenAI or Anthropic. There is no subscription; the provider bills the user directly.

How it works:
1. User purchases "Cloud AI"
2. User goes to Settings → AI & Summaries → Cloud AI
3. User enters their own API key from OpenAI or Anthropic
4. AI summaries are now generated using the external provider

Note: The app is fully functional without this purchase using on-device AI. This is a premium upgrade for users who want the highest quality summaries.

To test:
1. Go to Settings → AI & Summaries
2. Tap "Cloud AI" (it shows a lock and "One-time $2.99")
3. Complete the purchase
4. The API configuration section will unlock
```

4. Click **Save**

---

### Step 5: Submit the IAP for Review

1. At the top of the IAP page, check the **Status** (should show "Missing Metadata" initially)
2. Once all required fields are filled, status changes to **Ready to Submit**
3. Click **Save** if you haven't already

**Two submission options:**

**Option A: Submit with App** (Recommended for first release)

- The IAP will be reviewed when you submit your app update
- Go to your app version → Submit for Review
- The IAP is automatically included

**Option B: Submit IAP Separately** (For adding IAP to existing app)

- In the IAP list, select the IAP
- Click **Submit for Review** at the top
- Can be approved before app update

---

### Step 6: App-Level Requirements

Ensure these are configured in your app's App Store listing:

#### Privacy Policy (Required)

1. Go to **App Information** in App Store Connect
2. Scroll to **Privacy Policy URL**
3. Enter your privacy policy URL (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/privacy`)

Your privacy policy should mention:

- What data the app collects (audio recordings, transcripts)
- That transcription is on-device
- That API keys are stored securely on-device
- That external AI (if used) sends transcript data to the provider

#### Support URL (Required)

1. In **App Information**
2. Enter your support URL (e.g., `https://yourwebsite.com/support` or a GitHub issues page)

---

### Step 7: App Privacy Labels

In App Store Connect → Your App → **App Privacy**:

For Life Wrapped with IAP, you'll likely need to declare:

| Data Type                        | Purpose                                   | Linked to User? |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Purchases** → Purchase History | App Functionality                         | No              |
| **Audio Data** → Audio Data      | App Functionality                         | No              |
| **Identifiers** → Device ID      | App Functionality (if using for StoreKit) | No              |

**How to fill out:**

1. Click **Get Started** or **Edit**
2. Answer "Yes" to "Do you or your third-party partners collect data?"
3. Select applicable data types
4. For each type:
   - Select how it's used (App Functionality)
   - Indicate if it's linked to user identity (No, for privacy-first app)
   - Indicate if used for tracking (No)
5. Click **Publish**

---

### Step 8: Testing in Sandbox (Before Release)

Before submitting, test with real App Store Connect (not just Xcode StoreKit):

#### Create Sandbox Tester

1. In App Store Connect, go to **Users and Access**
2. Click **Sandbox** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Testers** → **+**
4. Fill in:
   - First Name: Test
   - Last Name: User
   - Email: `test-lifewrapped@example.com` (can be fake, but must be unique)
   - Password: Choose a secure password
   - Country: United States (or your primary market)
5. Click **Create**

#### Test on Real Device

1. On your iPhone/iPad: **Settings → App Store → Sign Out**
2. Run the app from Xcode (on device, not simulator)
3. Trigger a purchase in the app
4. When prompted, sign in with sandbox account credentials
5. Complete the purchase (no real charge)
6. Verify the feature unlocks correctly

> **Tip**: Don't sign into the main Settings app with the sandbox account - only use it when the App Store purchase sheet appears.
