# Quick Start: Testing Work/Personal Classification

## 🎯 Goal

Verify that Year Wrap items are correctly classified as Work/Personal/Both based on your session categories.

---

## ⚡ Quick Test (5 minutes)

### 1. Mark Some Sessions (2 min)

Open app → History tab → Tap sessions → Mark categories:

- Mark 3 sessions as **Work** 💼
- Mark 3 sessions as **Personal** 🏠
- Leave 2-3 **Uncategorized**

### 2. Regenerate Year Wrap (2 min)

Overview tab → Year Wrap card → Tap **Regenerate**

- Wait for AI to complete (~30 seconds)
- Watch logs for: `📊 Year 2025: X work, Y personal`

### 3. Check Results (1 min)

View Year Wrap → Look for category badges:

- **💼 Work** (blue) - From work sessions
- **🏠 Personal** (orange) - From personal sessions
- **🔄 Both** (purple) - Across both types

---

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Happen:

1. Sessions marked as Work → Items show 💼 Work badge
2. Sessions marked as Personal → Items show 🏠 Personal badge
3. Items appearing in both → Show 🔄 Both badge
4. PDF filters work: All / Work Only / Personal Only

### ❌ What Should NOT Happen:

1. All items showing as "Both" (old behavior)
2. AI guessing categories from content
3. Categories changing when regenerating with same sessions

---

## 🔍 How to Verify

### Check Console Logs:

```
📊 [SummaryCoordinator] Year 2025: 3 work sessions, 3 personal sessions out of 9 total
🔄 [SummaryCoordinator] Force regenerate enabled - will call AI
```

### Check Year Wrap UI:

- Open any insight section (Major Arcs, Wins, etc.)
- Each item should have a colored badge
- Different items should have different categories

### Test PDF Export:

1. Tap Share → Export PDF
2. Try each filter:
   - **All**: See all items with category prefixes
   - **Work Only**: Only items with 💼
   - **Personal Only**: Only items with 🏠

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "All items still showing 'Both'"

→ The Year Wrap wasn't regenerated with new code  
→ **Fix**: Tap Regenerate button again

### "No category context in logs"

→ Sessions aren't marked with categories  
→ **Fix**: Mark sessions as Work/Personal in detail view

### "Force regenerate not working"

→ Build might be stale  
→ **Fix**: Clean build folder, rebuild app

### "Old format warning in logs"

→ Existing Year Wrap from before this feature  
→ **Fix**: Normal, regenerate will create new format

## 📊 Test Matrix

| Sessions Marked  | Expected Result                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| All Work         | All items show 💼 Work              |
| All Personal     | All items show 🏠 Personal          |
| Mixed (50/50)    | Items split by source, some 🔄 Both |
| None categorized | Items default to 🔄 Both            |

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You're done when:

- [x] Sessions can be marked as Work/Personal
- [x] Year Wrap regenerates with new schema
- [x] Items display category badges
- [x] PDF filters work correctly
- [x] Makes intuitive sense

---

## 📝 Notes

- First regenerate after this change will take ~30s (AI call)
- Subsequent views are instant (cached)
- Old Year Wraps still work (backward compatible)
- Categories persist across app restarts
