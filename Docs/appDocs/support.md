## Frequently Asked Questions

### Recording & Transcription

**Q: Why isn't my transcription accurate?**
A: Transcription accuracy depends on several factors:

- Audio quality and microphone clarity
- Background noise levels
- Speaking clearly and at a moderate pace
- Language and accent recognition
  Try recording in a quiet environment and speaking clearly for best results.

**Q: Can I edit transcripts?**
A: Yes! Tap on any transcript segment to edit the text. Your changes are saved automatically.

**Q: Why does recording split into chunks?**
A: Life Wrapped automatically splits recordings into manageable chunks (configurable 30-300 seconds) for efficient processing. This allows parallel transcription and better memory management.

### AI Summaries

**Q: Which AI engine should I use?**
A: It depends on your needs:

- **Basic**: Fast, always available, 100% on-device
- **Local AI**: Better quality, 100% on-device, requires ~2GB download
- **Smartest (BYOK)**: Best quality, uses your OpenAI/Anthropic API keys

**Q: What does BYOK mean?**
A: BYOK stands for "Bring Your Own Key." You provide your own API key from OpenAI or Anthropic. You pay the API provider directly and maintain full control over your data.

**Q: Is my data sent to the cloud?**
A: Only if you choose to use External API (BYOK) for summaries. Transcription always happens 100% on-device. Basic and Local AI options are fully offline.
